# Step 2: Consular processing or Adjustment of Status processing

##### **Consular processing** and **adjustment of status** are two different processes for obtaining lawful permanent residence (a **green card**) in the United States. When a person chooses one process over the other depends on their circumstances and location.

### **🏛️ Consular Processing**:

##### This process is used when an **individual is outside the United States or ineligible to adjust status in the U.S.** In consular processing, the applicant applies for an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in their home country.

##### After the approval of the immigrant visa and completion of the required medical examination and background checks, the applicant can enter the U.S. as a permanent resident. Consular processing is the most common method for people obtaining a green card from abroad.

### **✒️📋 Adjustment of Status**:

##### This process is used when an **individual is already in the United States on a temporary visa and wishes to change their status to a permanent resident without leaving the country.**

##### Eligible applicants can file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The applicant's eligibility is evaluated, and if approved, their status is adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident.

> #### In summary, **consular processing** is typically done for ***individuals outside the U.S. or ineligible to adjust their status***.
>
> #### In contrast, **adjustment of status** is made for ***eligible** individuals **who are already in the U.S.*** and wish to obtain a green card without leaving the country.
