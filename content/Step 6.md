# Step 5: Elaborating your Resume

When elaborating your resume specifically for the EB2-NIW application, it is **essential to highlight your accomplishments, achievements, and contributions to your field**. Here are some tips on how to do that:

#### Start with a clear and concise summary:

Your resume should begin with a summary highlighting your critical skills, experience, and achievements. This summary should capture the readerâ€™s attention and make them want to read more.

#### Focus on your achievements:

Rather than just listing your job responsibilities, focus on your specific accomplishments and contributions in your field. Highlight any awards, publications, patents, or citations demonstrating your exceptional ability or advanced degree.

#### Use metrics:

Use specific metrics to quantify your accomplishments whenever possible. For example, if you increased sales or productivity in your previous job, including the percentage or dollar amount of that increase.

#### Tailor your resume to the EB2-NIW criteria:

Make sure your resume demonstrates how you meet the eligibility criteria for the EB2-NIW category. If you have an advanced degree, provide details of your degree and any relevant coursework or research. If you demonstrate exceptional ability, highlight specific achievements and evidence of recognition in your field.

#### Include relevant work experience:

Provide a comprehensive summary of your relevant work experience, including the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a brief description of your job duties.

#### Proofread and edit:

Ensure that your resume is error-free and well-organized. Have someone else review it for grammar and spelling errors, and consider hiring a professional resume writer or editor if necessary.
