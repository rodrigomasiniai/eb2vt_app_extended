# Step 9: Writing the Cover Letter

The letter should be written persuasively and compellingly to demonstrate that the petitioner meets the eligibility requirements for the EB-2 NIW category.

The cover letter is a critical component of the application and explains and summarizes the petitioner's qualifications, achievements, and proposed endeavor. The letter should be written persuasively and compellingly to demonstrate that the petitioner meets the eligibility requirements for the EB-2 NIW category.

A cover letter should:

1. Be easy to understand for non-experts in the field.
2. Reference all the essential documents attached.
3. Highlight the most critical aspects that support the case.
4. Be organized according to the requirements for EB2-NIW, for easy review.

By referencing the attached documents, the letter helps to create a comprehensive and persuasive case, making it easier for the officer to understand and evaluate the applicant's situation and request.
It is also important to print and attach materials from respected and reliable sources or government websites if they are referenced in the cover letter to support the National Interest Waiver (NIW). Including such materials can help provide additional evidence and support for your NIW petition and demonstrate to the USCIS officer that your proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance.

By including materials from respected sources, you can help to demonstrate the significance and impact of your proposed endeavor on the United States and its economy or society. These materials can also help establish your credibility and expertise in the relevant field and add weight to your case for the NIW.
When including materials from magazines or government websites, it is essential to ensure that they are respected and reputable sources and directly relevant to your proposed endeavor and its impact on the United States. It would be best if you also were sure to cite and label each piece of evidence with an exhibit number.

Here are the general steps to write a cover letter for an EB-2 NIW case:

1. **Introduction**: Introduce yourself and state the purpose of the letter. Briefly summarize your professional background, including education, work experience, and achievements. Describe the proposed endeavor briefly and explain why it is of national importance.
2. **Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability Section**: Provide a clear and concise summary of the evidence you submit to demonstrate that you meet the regulatory criteria for Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability, along with a brief description of the evidence you submit for each criterion.

To make your petition clear and organized, it is recommended to reference each piece of evidence cited in your petition with an exhibit number. This can help the USCIS officer quickly review your case to identify and locate the evidence you refer to.

For example, after citing a diploma and official transcript from XXXX, you could include a reference to the exhibit number in parentheses, like this: "I am submitting my diploma and an official transcript from XXXX (Exhibit 1), awarded in 2000, as well as a certificate and transcript of the Course XXX (Exhibit 2), completed in 2000."

### National Interest Waiver Section:

This is a critical component of an EB-2 NIW application, as it is intended to demonstrate that the petitioner's proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance and that the petitioner is well-positioned to advance it in the United States. It is also intended to show that waiving the labor certification would benefit the United States.

To help organize and present evidence effectively in the NIW section, it may be helpful to divide it into three subtopics:

1. **Substantial Merit and National Importance**: This subtopic should present evidence demonstrating that the proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance. This may include evidence of the potential economic, cultural, or scientific benefits resulting from the proposed endeavor. It may also include evidence of the unique or innovative nature of the proposed endeavor, and how it aligns with broader U.S. policy objectives.
2. **Well-positioned to advance the Proposed Endeavor**: This subtopic should present evidence demonstrating that the petitioner is well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor in the United States. This may include evidence of the petitioner's relevant experience, education, or training and any unique or specialized skills or expertise that the petitioner brings to the proposed endeavor. It may also include evidence of the petitioner's past successes in similar endeavors and any partnerships or collaborations that the petitioner has established to advance the proposed endeavor.
3. **It would benefit the United States to waive the labor certification**: This subtopic should present evidence demonstrating that waiving the labor certification requirement would benefit the United States. This may include evidence of the shortage of qualified workers in the petitioner's field and the potential economic, cultural, or scientific benefits that would result from granting the petitioner Permanent Residency in the United States. It may also include evidence of any partnerships or collaborations the petitioner has established with U.S. employers or the petitioner's intention to develop such partnerships or alliances in the future.

**Conclusion**: Summarize the key points and emphasize your qualifications and potential contributions to the United States.

ðŸ’¡It is essential to consult with an experienced professional to ensure that the petition letter is written by USCIS requirements and guidelines.
