# Step 6: Gathering documentation to substantiate the experiences and achievements highlighted in your resume

When applying for EB2-NIW, it is essential that the experiences and achievements highlighted in your resume can be substantiated by proper documentation. 

> ###### The USCIS may request evidence to support the claims made in your resume, so it is critical that you have the necessary documentation to back up your statements.

For example, if your resume states that you have contributed to your field through publications, you should be able to provide copies of those publications. If you have received awards or recognitions, you should have documentation to support those claims.

**Ensuring that any documentation you provide is accurate and up-to-date is also important**. 

⚠️ Providing false or misleading information can result in your application being denied or even lead to legal consequences.
