**At least three of the following criteria to qualify for exceptional ability:**

#### Academic records:

Submit official documents, such as diplomas, certificates, or similar awards from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to your area of exceptional ability.

Provide letters documenting at least ten years of full-time experience in your occupation, including detailed descriptions of your job duties and accomplishments. These letters should come from current or former employers. See the sample in **Step 6.**

Submit evidence of a license to practice your profession or certification for your profession or occupation, such as professional certifications, memberships, or other proof of your professional qualifications.
