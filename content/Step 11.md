# Step 10: Elaborating the Table of Contents

Create a detailed table of contents so that the USCIS officer reviewing your case can quickly locate the relevant documents and evidence.
In addition to all the required forms and documents, it is essential to note at the end of the Table of Contents, under **"Additional Supporting Materials,"** that information mentioned in the cover letter regarding the American market and official government information should be included as *Exhibits.*

We suggest creating a cover page to be placed before each section, with the titles: 

1. Forms,
2. Personal Documents,
3. Cover Letter,
4. Eligibility Criteria: Advanced Degree / Exceptional Ability,
5. National Interest Waiver,
6. Additional Supporting Materials.

We also suggest creating a cover page to be placed before each Exhibit, with the titles: 

* Exhibit 1 - Official Academic Record,
* Exhibit 2 - Academic Evaluation, etc.
