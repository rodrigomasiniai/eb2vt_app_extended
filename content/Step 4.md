# Step 4: Filling the Forms

##### **The Adjustment of Status (AOS) and Consular Processing** are two **distinct pathways for obtaining lawful permanent residence (green card)** in the United States. The primary difference between the two methods is based on the applicant's location and immigration status at the time of application.

## ✒️📋 Adjustment of Status:

##### As you saw in the previous Step, AOS is the process by which an eligible individual already in the United States can apply to become a lawful permanent resident without having to leave the country.

##### Applicants submit 📝 **Form I-485**, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to USCIS. This process applies to individuals who:

1. Are physically present in the United States
2. Have entered the U.S. legally and maintained a valid status

##### **During the AOS process**, applicants **may also apply for an Employment Authorization Document 💳 (EAD) and Advance Parole (AP) to 💼 work legally and ✈️ travel internationally while their application is pending.**

##### When applying for Adjustment of Status (AOS) for an EB2-NIW petition, you must complete and submit to USCIS the following forms.

##### You can access each form and the instructions to fill them out through the links.

### 📝Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status:

You must provide personal information, immigration history, and details about any dependents.

### 📝Form I-131, Application for Travel Document (optional):

## 🏛️ Consular Processing:

Once the immigrant petition (e.g., Form I-140) is approved, the National Visa Center (NVC) will notify the applicant and provide instructions for completing the required forms and submitting supporting documents.
