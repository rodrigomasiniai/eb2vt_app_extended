# Step 13: Processing of your EB2-NIW case by USCIS

After submitting your EB2-NIW case, you will receive a receipt notice from USCIS confirming that your application has been received and is being processed. 

**This notice will include a receipt number that you can use to track the status of your application online.**

Next, USCIS will conduct a preliminary review of your application to ensure that it is complete and that you have included all required documents and fees. 

> ##### If anything is missing or incomplete, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) asking you to provide additional information or documentation. You will find further details on this in Step 14.

Once your application is deemed complete, USCIS will begin processing it. This process can take several months, and the timeline may vary depending on the caseload of the USCIS office that is reviewing your application.


If your application is approved, you will receive a Notice of Approval in the mail. This notice will indicate the date on which your EB2-NIW petition was approved and will provide further instructions on how to proceed with consular processing or adjustment of status.

If your application is denied, you will receive a Notice of Denial in the mail. The notice will explain why your application was denied and whether or not you have the option to appeal the decision..

After filing your EB2-NIW, it is your responsibility to keep USCIS informed of any changes to your address. Failure to respond to an RFE in a timely manner may result in the denial of the application.

Processing times for EB2-NIW applications vary, but you can check the current processing times on the USCIS website.
