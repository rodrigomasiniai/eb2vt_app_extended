# Step 12: Submit your EB2-NIW case

After preparing your application package, make a copy of the entire application package for your records.

Then, if your case is an Adjustment of Status, before submitting the package to the USCIS you need to check the Visa Bulletin published by the Department of State each month to determine when you can file your EB2-NIW case (“Dates for Filing Applications”). Check the website: [uscis](https://www.uscis.gov/)


The Visa Bulletin shows the availability of immigrant visa numbers and provides the Priority Date for each category. **Your Priority Date is the date when your case will be filed with USCIS, and it is used to determine your place in line for an immigrant visa.**

If the Visa Bulletin shows that **your Priority Date is current or that a visa is available for your category, you can file your EB2-NIW case.** 

However, if the Visa Bulletin shows that **“Dates for Filing Applications” is not current, you will have to wait until it becomes current before you can file your case.** 

> ##### Keep in mind that the Visa Bulletin can change each month, so it is important to check it regularly to stay up-to-date on when you can file your case.

If your Adjustment of Status Priority Date is current, you can submit your EB2-NIW package to the appropriate USCIS lockbox facility.
