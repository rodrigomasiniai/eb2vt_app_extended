# Step 3: Determine Your Eligibility

##### You can start building your case if you are eligible for EB2-NIW through Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability.

##### To qualify for the EB2-NIW visa, you must meet the following criteria:

##### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è possess an advanced degree (master's, doctorate, or bachelor's degree plus five years of progressive work experience),

##### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è or possess exceptional ability in your field.

## üéì Advanced degree

##### The Advanced degree criteria refer to the minimum educational qualifications a candidate must possess to be eligible. The requirements for an advanced degree are as follows:

1. The applicant ‚ö†Ô∏è **must hold a U.S. master's degree or higher (or its foreign equivalent)** in the field where they intend to work. The degree must be directly related to their area of expertise or specialization.

#### **OR**

2. The applicant ‚ö†Ô∏è **must hold a U.S. bachelor's degree (or its foreign equivalent) and have at least five years of progressive post-bachelor work experience in their field**. In this case, combining the bachelor's degree and the five years of work experience is equivalent to a master's degree.

#### When applying for an EB2 visa under the advanced degree criteria, providing proper documentation to support your qualifications is essential. This may include:

1. Official academic records, such as diplomas, certificates, and transcripts from the educational institutions you attended.
2. Evidence of your foreign degree's equivalency to a U.S. degree, if applicable. This can be obtained through a credential evaluation from a reputable evaluation agency.
3. Letters from current or former employers detailing your work experience, job duties, and duration of employment, especially if you are relying on a bachelor's degree plus five years of progressive experience.
4. Meeting the advanced degree criteria is just one aspect of the EB2- NIW visa application. You must also demonstrate that your work is in the national interest and that you have the necessary skills, expertise, and achievements to contribute significantly to your field in the United States. **This will be addressed in detail later in this tutorial.**

## üèÜ Exceptional Ability

##### To qualify as an individual with exceptional ability, you must meet üëâ at least three of the following criteria:

1. **Official academic records** showing that you have a degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to your area of exceptional ability.
2. **Letters documenting at least ten years of full-time experience** in your occupation. These letters should come from current or former employers and describe your job duties and accomplishments.
3. **A license to practice your profession in your country or certification for your profession or occupation**. This could include professional certifications, memberships, or other evidence of your professional qualifications.
4. **Evidence that you have commanded a salary or other service remuneration demonstrating your exceptional ability**. This can be shown through pay stubs, tax returns, or employer letters confirming your salary history.
5. **Membership in professional associations** that require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields.
6. **Recognition for your achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field** by your peers, government entities, and professional or business organizations. This can be through awards, honors, or other recognitions for your work and accomplishments.
7. Other comparable evidence of eligibility, such as **published articles or research, patents, significant participation in industry-related conferences or seminars**, or any other documentation demonstrating your exceptional field ability.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è OBSERVATIONS
