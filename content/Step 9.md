# Step 8: Documentation to evidence you qualify for NIW National Interest Waiver - Professional Plan, Business Plan, and Support Letters

The National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a waiver of the labor certification requirement for the employment-based second preference (EB-2) immigrant visa category.

It allows individuals who are members of certain professions or fields of endeavor to apply for permanent residency in the United States without the need for an employer to sponsor them or obtain a labor certification.

> ##### The NIW is granted to individuals who can demonstrate that their work is in the national interest of the United States, which means that it would substantially benefit the country as a whole, rather than just their employer or themselves.

To obtain an NIW, an individual must submit a **detailed petition and provide extensive evidence demonstrating their qualifications and the national importance of their work.** Some documents that can evidence you qualify for NIW will be described in this section.

## **📝✨ Professional Plan**

The Professional Plan aims to inform USCIS officials of your **professional experience and professional plans (endeavors) in the United States.** It is the only document where you can address the immigration officer directly.

It is a letter written in the first person, demonstrating that your work is in the national interest of the United States.

This requires meeting the three-prong test established in the precedent case **Matter of Dhanasar**:

1. 💎 That your professional plans in the United States have intrinsic merit and national importance;
2. 🚀 That you are professionally well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor;
3. 🌟 And that it would benefit the United States to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements.

> ###### The Professional Plan is a crucial component of the EB2-NIW petition strategy.

It is the core document showcasing your proposed endeavor's intrinsic merit and national importance related to your professional qualifications. It is the primary document where you directly address USCIS officials, explaining why you should be granted the National Interest Waiver.

It's crucial to ensure that all the documents submitted as part of the EB2-NIW petition are coherent and consistent with the Professional Plan to strengthen your case and increase your chances of approval.

### **S****tructuring the**** Professional Plan:**

We suggest structuring the professional plan into four sections:

1. introduction,
2. professional background,
3. proposed endeavor, and
4. national importance.

The **introduction** should provide an overview of your qualifications and proposed endeavor. It should capture the reader's attention and give a clear understanding of what the rest of the document will cover.

The section on the **professional background** should detail your academic qualifications and highlight the critical aspects of your professional experience. This section should highlight your achievements and expertise and show how your background has prepared you to pursue your proposed endeavor.

The **proposed endeavor** is the most important section of the document. It should detail how you intend to work in the U.S., including the job title, the specific services or products you plan to offer, your target market, and your business model. The more detailed the information is, the better. This section should demonstrate a proposed endeavor with intrinsic merit and national importance.

**If you require assistance, we suggest seeking the guidance of an [expert to help you develop your proposed endeavor](https://www.progresspath.us), as it serves as the core strategy of your case.**

In the Proposed Endeavor section, you should specify critical information, the job title, to which we should give greater attention.

A job title is a term that describes the position or role of an individual within a company or organization. It typically indicates the level of seniority or responsibility associated with the position and is used to identify and differentiate between various job roles. Examples of job titles include manager, accountant, physical therapist, and software engineer.

When determining your job title, choose one that accurately reflects your current or proposed position and aligns with your education, experience, and skills. It should also be consistent with the job duties and responsibilities outlined in your employment letter and other supporting documents.
You can research job titles within your industry and field to find a suitable title or consult with a career expert for guidance. It's important to avoid using vague or inflated job titles, as this may raise red flags for the USCIS.

You can research job titles within your industry and field to find a suitable title or consult with a career expert for guidance. It's important to avoid using vague or inflated job titles, as this may raise red flags for the USCIS.
Examples of vague or inflated job titles can include:
"Master of the Universe" instead of Director
"Social Media Ninja" instead of Social Media Manager
"Customer Happiness Guru" instead of Customer Service Representative
"Brand Evangelist" instead of Marketing Manager

"Chief People Officer" instead of Human Resources Director
"Happiness Engineer" instead of Technical Support Specialist
"Growth Hacker" instead of Marketing Manager
"Digital Prophet" instead of Digital Marketing Specialist

"Wizard of Light Bulb Moments" instead of Innovation Consultant
"Director of First Impressions" instead of Receptionist

Ultimately, your job title should be a truthful representation of your professional background and proposed endeavor and should align with the overall narrative of your EB2-NIW petition.
Accurate job titles depend on the specific job duties and responsibilities. Here are some examples of accurate job titles for different professions:
Software Developer
Mechanical Engineer
Human Resources Manager
Marketing Coordinator
Accountant
Registered Nurse
Attorney
Sales Representative
Project Manager
Data Analyst

**Once you have identified your job title, find its corresponding Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code and enter it in the relevant fields** of the form I-140 **in Part 6, Item 2. In Item 1, enter your job title, and in Item 3, provide a description of your proposed endeavor.**

Finally, the **national importance** section should explain how your proposed endeavor will benefit the United States and contribute to its national interest. This section should provide evidence that your endeavor will improve the economy, create jobs, or otherwise benefit the country.

By following this structure, you can ensure that your professional plan is comprehensive and well-organized, making it easier for USCIS agents to understand and evaluate your eligibility for the EB2-NIW visa category.
Here's a simple and summarized example of structuring your Professional Plan. Remember that the Proposed Endeavor and National Importance section should be as specific as possible.

> #### We highly recommend that you indicate your intention to provide consulting services, when possible, either as an independent consultant or through your own company, to avoid needing a job offer. Otherwise, USCIS may question your need for a sponsor, your intention to fill an American professional job, or your potential to exclusively benefit the company you plan to work for.

While this can be done by your own, those cases that had a specialized assistance increased their chances of approval. Therefore we recommend our [partner](https://www.progresspath.com) that can assist you in developing a strong strategy and also provides a service to create a Professional Plan.

## **💼📝 Business Plan**

If your proposed endeavor involves working on your own business (as in the example above), we highly recommend attaching a detailed Business Plan to your case, to describe the company exclusively.

This is particularly important if your plan involves entrepreneurship when you are going to establish a new business. When submitting an EB-2 NIW petition, **including a Business Plan can help demonstrate your proposed endeavor's viability and potential success. It can also provide information on the number of jobs that will be created, the financial investment required, the anticipated revenue, and other relevant details.**

For example, if your proposed endeavor is to establish a software development company, a Business Plan could provide information on the market demand for the services you will offer, the projected revenue, the number of jobs that will be created, and the expected financial investment required. This information can help demonstrate the national importance of your proposed endeavor and show that it has the potential to contribute positively to the U.S. economy.

> ###### The business plan format for the USCIS has some unique components and topics that are not covered in traditional business plan.

**We highly recommend seeking the assistance of a company that specializes in creating Business Plans for EB2-NIW immigration purposes. ****[Businessforvisas](https://www.businessforvisas.com)**** is an experienced company with professionals who can help develop a Business Plan specifically tailored to your EB2-NIW case.**

## Support Letters - recommendation letters and intention letters

Support letters, also known as recommendation letters, are written by individuals who know the applicant professionally and can vouch for their qualifications and achievements. In the context of an EB2-NIW petition, support letters are essential to the application, as they provide additional evidence of the applicant's exceptional ability and national importance.

The letters should come from experts in the applicant's field or others who can speak to the applicant's qualifications and contributions. These letters should describe your accomplishments, explain how your work benefits the United States, and provide specific examples of your unique expertise.

## Intention Letters

An intention letter for immigration is a document written by an individual or organization expressing their intention to use the petitioner's services in the United States. This letter serves as additional evidence to support the petitioner's claim that their proposed endeavor has national importance and will benefit the United States.

The intention letter should include the specific services or products the petitioner will provide and the benefits the petitioner's services will bring to the recipient. It should also include the contact information of the individual or organization providing the letter. The intention letter can be from potential clients, collaborators, or partners in the proposed endeavor.

It is important to note that an intention letter is not a contract and does not create any legal obligation. Instead, it serves as evidence of potential future employment or collaboration and can help support the petitioner's case for EB2-NIW.

### **Number of letters**

We suggest obtaining at **least 3-5 support letters** (*for example, three recommendation letters and two intention letters*). If you can get some letters from American professionals or companies expressing interest in your services, it can significantly strengthen your case. However, it is essential to focus on obtaining strong recommendation letters if you cannot obtain such letters.

---

### **Resume**

When requesting letters of recommendation from individuals in support of your EB-2 NIW petition, it is recommended that you request that each individual provide a detailed resume or CV to accompany their letter of recommendation. This is because the USCIS officer reviewing your petition may want to evaluate the credentials and qualifications of the individuals writing the letters to better understand their expertise and how it relates to your proposed endeavor.

By including the resumes or CVs of each individual providing a letter of recommendation, you can give the USCIS officer additional context and information about the individuals supporting your petition. This can help to strengthen your case and provide a complete picture of your qualifications and expertise.
Additionally, including resumes or CVs can help demonstrate the credibility and expertise of the individuals providing letters of recommendation, which can further strengthen your case. By highlighting the credentials and accomplishments of the individuals writing the letters, you can help establish their authority and expertise in the relevant field, adding weight to their recommendations.

The letter’s information must be aligned and coherent with other documents, including the Professional and Business Plan.

Here is an example of a recommendation letter based on the Professional Plan sample.
