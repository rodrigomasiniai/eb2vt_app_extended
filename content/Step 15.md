# Step 14: Request for Evidence

After filing your I-140, USCIS will review your application and may request additional information or evidence. Respond promptly to any Requests for Evidence (RFE) to avoid delays in your application process.

### **What is a Request for Evidence:**


A Request for Evidence (RFE) is a document sent by the USCIS to the petitioner requesting additional evidence or information in support of their EB2-NIW case. 

The USCIS may issue an RFE if they determine that the evidence provided in the initial application package is insufficient to establish eligibility for the requested immigration benefits. 

The RFE will specify the additional evidence or information that is required, and the petitioner will usually have a set period of time to respond with the requested evidence. 

Failure to respond to an RFE or provide the requested evidence within the specified timeframe can result in the denial of the EB2-NIW application.

The deadline for an RFE generally appears at the bottom of the RFE document, informing the applicant how long they have to gather the missing evidence and submit the documents to the USCIS. Typically, within 30 â€“ 90 days.

An RFE (Form I-797E) may be issued by USCIS if an application lacks sufficient evidence to make a final decision. However, receiving an RFE does not automatically mean that your application will be denied. An RFE is a chance for the applicant to provide more evidence and potentially receive approval.


Another type of request for evidence is called Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID). 

**A NOID is more severe than an RFE** as it means that the USCIS has evaluated your application and found you ineligible based on the initial evidence provided, whereas an RFE is simply a request for additional information. 

While an RFE does not necessarily mean your application will be denied, receiving a NOID indicates that the USCIS has made a negative determination, and you must act quickly to salvage your application.

In the event that you receive a NOID, it is highly recommended to seek the assistance of an experienced immigration attorney. If you fail to respond with convincing evidence within the specified timeframe, your petition will be immediately denied.

### **How to ****answer**** an RFE**


After gathering your evidence, make a copy of the RFE and keep it for your records. 

Put the original RFE (Form I-797E) at the front of your response packet as USCIS will need it to scan and process your response upon submission. Failing to include the original RFE may cause delays in processing time.

Next, draft a cover letter outlining the contents of your response packet. 

Try to organize the cover letter in a format similar to the RFE for ease of understanding. If you included additional evidence that was not requested, explain why you included it and how it may affect your application. Keep a copy of the cover letter and the Form I-797E in your records.


Once your response is ready, mail the response packet to the address specified on the RFE, which may differ from the address you sent your application or the return address on the envelope when you received the RFE.
