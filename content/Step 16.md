# Step 15: Approval

If your application is approved, you will receive a Notice of Approval of your I-140 in the mail. 

This notice will indicate the date on which your EB2-NIW petition was approved and will provide further instructions on how to proceed with consular processing or adjustment of status.

## **‚úíÔ∏èüìã Adjustment of Status processing**:


When your I-140 is approved, and you have also applied for Adjustment of Status (AOS), you will need to wait for the priority date to become current before your AOS application can be processed. 

The priority date is the date when your I-140 petition was filed.

You can check this updated information on the USCIS website.

Once your priority date becomes current, your AOS application will be processed by USCIS. This includes completing necessary background checks, attending an interview with a USCIS officer, and providing additional evidence or documentation as requested.

If your AOS application is approved, you will be granted lawful permanent resident status (a green card) and can permanently remain in the United States.

## **üèõÔ∏è Consular processing:**

When your I-140 petition for consular processing is approved, you must go through the consular processing procedure. This process involves the following steps:

1. The approved I-140 petition is sent to the National Visa Center (NVC), which will forward the case to the appropriate U.S. embassy or consulate.
2. The embassy or consulate will notify you of the following steps, typically submitting additional documents and scheduling an interview.
3. You must attend an interview with a consular officer to determine your eligibility for the visa. The consular officer will review your application and supporting documents and may ask you questions to assess your qualifications.

If the consular officer approves your visa application, you will be issued an immigrant visa. You can then use this visa to enter the United States as a permanent resident.

Once you enter the United States, you will receive your permanent resident card (green card) in the mail within a few weeks.
