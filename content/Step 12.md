# Step 11: Prepare your application package

The application package refers to the complete set of documents and forms that are submitted to the USCIS for the purpose of applying for a specific immigration benefit. In the context of an EB2-NIW application, the application package would include all the required forms, supporting documents, and evidence necessary to demonstrate the applicant's eligibility for the National Interest Waiver. The package should be organized and presented in a way that is easy for the USCIS officer to review and evaluate.

When preparing your application package, follow the steps:

#### Create a cover page to be the first page of your EB-2 NIW binder, containing the following information:

**EB2-National Interest Waiver**

**Beneficiary: (your full name)**

#### Next, follow the order established in the Table of Contents.

This means arranging your documents in the same order as they appear in the Table of Contents, starting with the Forms section and continuing to the Additional Supporting Materials section.

We suggest placing a cover page before each section, with the titles: 

**I. Forms,** 

**II. Personal Documents,** 

**III. Cover Letter,** 

**IV. Eligibility Criteria: Advanced Degree / Exceptional Ability,** 

**V. National Interest Waiver,** 

**VI. Additional Supporting Materials.**

**Attach small adhesive labels to the edges of each Exhibit cover page**, with the exhibit number marked on the label. 

> ##### The label should be small and rectangular, with a transparent adhesive backing to easily attach to the edge of a page.

When attaching exhibit labels to your EB-2 NIW binder pages, it is essential to avoid placing them one behind the other. 

Instead, the tags should be attached to allow the USCIS officer to view all of them when the binder is closed.

This means positioning the labels along the edge of the page to allow them to be easily visible and readable when the binder is closed. 

You may need to adjust the placement of the labels to ensure that they do not overlap or interfere with one another and that they are arranged in a way that allows them to be easily viewed.

> ##### This labeling system is an essential aspect of preparing your EB-2 NIW binder, as it helps to identify and organize the exhibits clearly and easily. Labeling each exhibit with its corresponding exhibit number can help the USCIS officer review your petition quickly and easily locate the relevant documents and evaluate their significance to your case.
